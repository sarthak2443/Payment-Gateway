# Payment-Gateway
A payment gateway is a technology that enables merchants to accept online payments from customers using credit cards, debit cards, or other electronic methods. A payment gateway acts as an intermediary between the customer's browser and the merchant's bank, encrypting and transmitting the payment information securely.
